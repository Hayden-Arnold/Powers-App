# Powers

This is an application that lets my friends share their social media links with our group of friends.

## Project Description

In this project I will be using a mixture of React, JavaScript and CSS to make an application for my friends and I. The API I will be using comes from Airtable (https://airtable.com/). The purpose of this app is to make some of our social media links easy and more accessible to our friend group. Here you will be able to see other peoples information and also upload your own.

Here is the deployed site!: https://61b12b98d47e58000872f485--powersapp.netlify.app/

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I understand what I want to make of my application. I understand the core concepts and I feel comfortable with the large majority of the project.

### Weaknesses:

Styling is my weakness right now. I have not had enough practice yet and I know certain styles will be more difficult to produce then working with the functionality of my project.

### Opportunities:

Learning react has been a combination of 2 weeks, or roughly 120+ hours of work and many long nights. But with this project I will solitify my understanding of both react and more JavaScript/CSS. I will use this as a way to push my limits within react and hopefully use it as a valuable lesson in coding.

### Threats:

Making this application to the height I want it to be within the time limit I have.
